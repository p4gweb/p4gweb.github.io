I thought I heard something about the Germans giving us a satellite, is that Phase 4? * Why can't we just do another AO-10/13/40 style satellite? * When is the launch? Expected answer is that the current best guess as of __date-you-are-writing-this__ is that the launch will be __launch-date-year-quarter__ but that this is likely/not-likely/certainly going to change. * When can I use the satellite? How long after launch will it be available to amateurs? * What are the uplink/downlink bands (note: bands, not exact frequencies)? * Why do we have to use those uplink/downlink bands? * Why isn't __my-favorite-band-that-I-already-have-radios-for__ going to be used on this satellite? * Can I work this satellite with my HT? * How much is it going to cost me to get the right kind of radios to use this satellite? What kind of antennas do I need? * Can someone explain to me if this is going to have an analog or a digital transponder? Can I actually talk to people or will this be another beep-sat? * What is this ARAP thing? * How far will I be able to work DX / what is the foot print going to be? * It's geostationary/geosynchronous/geo-what? Really? Where is the satellite going to be in the sky when viewed from my house? * What do you mean that the footprint isn't going to change from minute-to-minute like every other amateur satellite? How much do you think the footprint will move per day? per year? * How long will this satellite be alive / how long will it keep working ? * Where are we at with this project? How far along is this project ? Is it done yet? * What does the project need help with? What skills are needed? How can I help make this happen? * If Qatar or some other country launches a satellite will we be able to cross-link/connect the two satellite together to work further DX? * Will I be able to collect telemetry? How? What kind of telemetry will be sent down? What kind of equipment will I need so that I can collect telemetry? ### Oh, you wanted answers too...</div> </div> </div>
