I thought I heard something about the Germans giving us a satellite, is that Phase 4?</li> <li>Why can’t we just do another AO-10/13/40 style satellite?</li> <li>When is the launch? Expected answer is that the current best guess as of <strong>date-you-are-writing-this</strong> is that the launch will be <strong>launch-date-year-quarter</strong> but that this is likely/not-likely/certainly going to change.</li> <li>When can I use the satellite? How long after launch will it be available to amateurs?</li> <li>What are the uplink/downlink bands (note: bands, not exact frequencies)?</li> <li>Why do we have to use those uplink/downlink bands?</li> <li>Why isn’t <strong>my-favorite-band-that-I-already-have-radios-for</strong> going to be used on this satellite?</li> <li>Can I work this satellite with my HT?</li> <li>How much is it going to cost me to get the right kind of radios to use this satellite? What kind of antennas do I need?</li> <li>Can someone explain to me if this is going to have an analog or a digital transponder? Can I actually talk to people or will this be another beep-sat?</li> <li>What is this ARAP thing?</li> <li>How far will I be able to work DX / what is the foot print going to be?</li> <li>It’s geostationary/geosynchronous/geo-what? Really? Where is the satellite going to be in the sky when viewed from my house?</li> <li>What do you mean that the footprint isn’t going to change from minute-to-minute like every other amateur satellite? How much do you think the footprint will move per day? per year?</li> <li>How long will this satellite be alive / how long will it keep working ?</li> <li>Where are we at with this project? How far along is this project ? Is it done yet?</li> <li>What does the project need help with? What skills are needed? How can I help make this happen?</li> <li>If Qatar or some other country launches a satellite will we be able to cross-link/connect the two satellite together to work further DX?</li> <li>Will I be able to collect telemetry? How? What kind of telemetry will be sent down? What kind of equipment will I need so that I can collect telemetry? </ul> <h3>Oh, you wanted answers too…</h3> </div> </div> </div>
