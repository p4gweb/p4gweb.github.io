For the full 10MHz, you’ll need more RF bandwidth. Fortunately there’s a lot of choices and we’ll be setting up our stations to test them out. The baseline controller is a Raspberry Pi, and that may not have enough horsepower to decode our forward error correction, but we are making progress on that as well. Being part of and supporting the SATNOGs network sounds like a step forward, and because all of this is open source, we have the opportunity to adapt an existing, working, quality design to our needs."),Qo.forEach(f),Ya=m(e),Za=c(e,"P",{});var Ko=u(Za);$a=p(Ko,"Not a bad report for what we did over winter vacation!"),Ko.forEach(f),eo=m(e),ao=c(e,"P",{});var Yo=u(ao);oo=p(Yo,"Have a great weekend and see you on Monday."),Yo.forEach(f),this.h()},h:function(){g(t,"href","https://phase4ground.github.io/"),g(t,"rel","nofollow"),g(T,"href","https://www.dvb.org/"),g(T,"rel","nofollow"),g(U,"href","https://www.gnuradio.org/"),g(U,"rel","nofollow"),g(Q,"href","https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLavdGnjBLuiX97DAKk32NJ1bCF1a0cv01"),g(Q,"rel","nofollow"),g(ae,"href","https://phase4space.github.io/"),g(ae,"rel","nofollow"),g(he,"href","https://www.amsat.org/volunteer-for-amsat/"),g(he,"rel","nofollow"),g(ue,"href","mailto:w5nyv@arrl.net"),g(je,"href","https://upsat.gr/"),g(je,"rel","nofollow"),g(Ue,"href","https://gitlab.com/librespacefoundation/satnogs/gr-satnogs"),g(Ue,"rel","nofollow"),g(Xe,"href","http://hamradio360.com/index.php/2018/01/01/ham-radio-workbench-amsat-phase-4b-ground-station-design/"),g(Xe,"rel","nofollow"),g(ea,"href","https://radiowirelessweek.org/"),g(ea,"rel","nofollow"),g(ha,"href","https://github.com/phase4ground/documents/blob/master/Papers_Articles_Presentations/Slide_Presentations/20171208_GitHubEnterpriseProposal.pdf"),g(ha,"rel","nofollow"),g(wa,"href","https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/48/252.204-7012"),g(wa,"rel","nofollow"),g(ya,"href","http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171.pdf"),g(ya,"rel","nofollow"),g(Ca,"href","https://hackaday.io/project/19121-andxor-dc25-badge"),g(Ca,"rel","nofollow"),g(Ma,"href","https://jococruise.com/"),g(Ma,"rel","nofollow")},m:function(e,l){w(e,a,l),b(a,o),b(a,t),b(t,r),w(e,n,l),w(e,s,l),b(s,i),w(e,y,l),w(e,P,l),b(P,k),w(e,E,l),w(e,S,l),b(S,A),b(S,T),b(T,G),b(S,I),w(e,W,l),w(e,j,l),b(j,N),w(e,x,l),w(e,D,l),b(D,R),w(e,B,l),w(e,C,l),b(C,F),w(e,H,l),w(e,L,l),b(L,O),b(L,U),b(U,_),w(e,M,l),w(e,V,l),b(V,J),w(e,X,l),w(e,q,l),b(q,z),b(q,Q),b(Q,K),b(q,Y),w(e,Z,l),w(e,$,l),b($,ee),b($,ae),b(ae,oe),w(e,te,l),w(e,re,l),b(re,ne),w(e,se,l),w(e,ie,l),b(ie,le),b(ie,he),b(he,de),b(ie,ce),b(ie,ue),b(ue,pe),b(ie,fe),w(e,me,l),w(e,ge,l),b(ge,we),w(e,be,l),w(e,ve,l),b(ve,ye),w(e,Pe,l),w(e,ke,l),b(ke,Ee),w(e,Se,l),w(e,Ae,l),b(Ae,Te),w(e,Ge,l),w(e,Ie,l),b(Ie,We),b(Ie,je),b(je,Ne),w(e,xe,l),w(e,De,l),b(De,Re),w(e,Be,l),w(e,Ce,l),b(Ce,Fe),w(e,He,l),w(e,Le,l),b(Le,Oe),b(Le,Ue),b(Ue,_e),w(e,Me,l),w(e,Ve,l),b(Ve,Je),b(Ve,Xe),b(Xe,qe),w(e,ze,l),w(e,Qe,l),b(Qe,Ke),w(e,Ye,l),w(e,Ze,l),b(Ze,$e),b(Ze,ea),b(ea,aa),b(Ze,oa),w(e,ta,l),w(e,ra,l),b(ra,na),w(e,sa,l),w(e,ia,l),b(ia,la),b(ia,ha),b(ha,da),w(e,ca,l),w(e,ua,l),b(ua,pa),w(e,fa,l),w(e,ma,l),b(ma,ga),b(ma,wa),b(wa,ba),b(ma,va),b(ma,ya),b(ya,Pa),w(e,ka,l),w(e,Ea,l),b(Ea,Sa),w(e,Aa,l),w(e,Ta,l),b(Ta,Ga),w(e,Ia,l),w(e,Wa,l),b(Wa,ja),w(e,Na,l),w(e,xa,l),b(xa,Da),w(e,Ra,l),w(e,Ba,l),b(Ba,Ca),b(Ca,Fa),w(e,Ha,l),w(e,La,l),b(La,Oa),w(e,Ua,l),w(e,_a,l),b(_a,Ma),b(Ma,Va),w(e,Ja,l),w(e,Xa,l),b(Xa,qa),w(e,za,l),w(e,Qa,l),b(Qa,Ka),w(e,Ya,l),w(e,Za,l),b(Za,$a),w(e,eo,l),w(e,ao,l),b(ao,oo)},p:v,i:v,o:v,d:function(e){e&&f(a),e&&f(n),e&&f(s),e&&f(y),e&&f(P),e&&f(E),e&&f(S),e&&f(W),e&&f(j),e&&f(x),e&&f(D),e&&f(B),e&&f(C),e&&f(H),e&&f(L),e&&f(M),e&&f(V),e&&f(X),e&&f(q),e&&f(Z),e&&f($),e&&f(te),e&&f(re),e&&f(se),e&&f(ie),e&&f(me),e&&f(ge),e&&f(be),e&&f(ve),e&&f(Pe),e&&f(ke),e&&f(Se),e&&f(Ae),e&&f(Ge),e&&f(Ie),e&&f(xe),e&&f(De),e&&f(Be),e&&f(Ce),e&&f(He),e&&f(Le),e&&f(Me),e&&f(Ve),e&&f(ze),e&&f(Qe),e&&f(Ye),e&&f(Ze),e&&f(ta),e&&f(ra),e&&f(sa),e&&f(ia),e&&f(ca),e&&f(ua),e&&f(fa),e&&f(ma),e&&f(ka),e&&f(Ea),e&&f(Aa),e&&f(Ta),e&&f(Ia),e&&f(Wa),e&&f(Na),e&&f(xa),e&&f(Ra),e&&f(Ba),e&&f(Ha),e&&f(La),e&&f(Ua),e&&f(_a),e&&f(Ja),e&&f(Xa),e&&f(za),e&&f(Qa),e&&f(Ya),e&&f(Za),e&&f(eo),e&&f(ao)}}}var k=function(a){e(l,s);var o=y(l);function l(e){var a;return t(this,l),a=o.call(this),r(n(a),e,null,P,i,{}),a}return l}();export default k;
