# 20201001 Weekly Engineering Report

ORI board meeting was held this past week. Minutes from February 2020 were approved and minutes from this meeting will be published via email approval shortly. 

An ORI "Office Hours" for Phase 4 Ground and Space was held this past week. 

A SNAP-R number was requested. We will need to obtain a SNAP-R ID, also called a Company Identification Number (CIN), for the Open Research Institute for the Department of Commerceâ€™s SNAP-R system. The SNAP-R system is used for filing commodity classification requests and license applications. This is part of the process of moving our work out from under EAR, using the open source carve out in that set of regulations. 

HamCation 2021 booth reservation was canceled. We look forward to being able to support volunteers to in-person events when it's safe to do so.

ORI was featured at the October 2020 San Bernardino Microwave Society monthly meeting. For this presentation, we updated our website with a Getting Started section. This has been asked for by several volunteers and supporters, so we took the opportunity to create the content and reference it as part of the talk. 

Phase 4 Ground has submitted multiple papers and talks to the upcoming AMSAT Symposium on 17 October 2020. 

FPGA team is making progress on physical layer framing for DVB-S2 communications. 

ORI successfully concluded another year of sponsorship and volunteerism with the GNU Radio Project. ORI handled banking, logistics, presentation reviewing, scheduling, program, contracts, and other duties for the Virtual GNU Radio Conference 2020. ORI completed all basic contracting for GNU Radio Conference 2021 in Charlotte, NC without incurring any cancellation fees. GNU Radio will become part of SETI Institute later this year, which is a fantastic development and will open up opportunities and resources for the GNU Radio community.
