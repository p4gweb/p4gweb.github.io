The purpose of the meeting was to explore the idea of a careful COTS of the E310 and X310 Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) devices. </p> <p>The USRP is a range of software-defined radios designed and sold by Ettus Research and its parent company, National Instruments. Our goal is HEO or GEO with a USRP based design. </p> <p>Nate and Neel described the USRP lineup, gave a brief history of Ettus Research, and expressed their enthusiasm for an effort in this direction. </p> <p>The most significant action item resulting from this meeting was to include additional Ettus Research personnel for business planning and engineering scoping. In order to complete this item, we will schedule a conference to be held either in two weeks, at the next ASCENT call, or at another published time.</p> <p>One engineering possibility discussed was to revisit and re-activate the Tritium line as a base design. Phase 4 Space is interested in a part at least as large as the 7045, and is interested in using the UNISEC electrical bus standard. The Tritium was not productized, and is not on the current Ettus Research product roadmap, but was demonstrated at GNU Radio Conference and other events. </p> <p>Tritium was specifically seen as the most appropriate radio, due to its physical size, and it being on one board. Even E310 was seen as being too large, and would require a new layout and re-spin. And same problem, even worse, for X310. Upcoming products such as E320 were also too large.</p> <p>Gerber files and a full bill of materials are not publicly released by Ettus for their USRPs. These items may also be under NDA for a careful COTS version. This is an area of active discussion.</p> <p>Members of GOLF also attended the ASCENT call, and expressed interest in this effort, which is really wonderful news. Their primary concern was board size. </p> <p>In all space deployments, heat dissipation is key. The layout will have to address heat dissipation, as the current layouts all rely on convective dissipation through heat sinks. </p> <p>Open Research Institute and Phase 4 Ground and Space</p> <p>Over the past year, we’ve been struggling to figure out how best to run a pure Open Source project, that is potentially subject to ITAR and EAR, within AMSAT. We’re also concerned with making sure that project-earmarked contributions go directly to Phase 4 Ground, and that the project is run with a flat and collaborative organizational structure more typical of an Open Source project.</p> <p>In January, Michelle Thompson and Bruce Perens decided to form a separate corporation deliberately structured for operating pure Open Source projects that are subject to ITAR and EAR, and to operate the Phase 4 Ground development within that corporation with AMSAT as the main flight customer. We asked to be affiliated with AMSAT as a Member Society. This option is in the AMSAT bylaws and fits our situation very well to the benefit of both the Phase 4 program and AMSAT Incorporated. </p> <p>Our organization is called Open Research Institute, Inc. and is incorporated in California. The directors are Michelle, Bruce, and Ben Hilburn (of GNU Radio fame). Unlike AMSAT, “no secrets” is the rule for ORI, and this actually protects us under carve-outs in ITAR and EAR for published information. We are registering as a charity with the State of California today, and are in process to file for recognition as a 501(c)3 tax-exempt organization with IRS, using a professional firm to prepare our application.</p> <p>Joe Spier and Dr. Robert McGwier have been briefed and are in support of this effort.</p> <p>From the perspective of the Phase 4 participant, little will change. We will be developing a “corporate veil” to protect you better, including liability insurance and patent lawsuit protection. We will have a new address for donations that are specifically for Phase4 Ground. We have some new online facilities. We will continue to work very hard to help AMSAT, publish and promote <em>your</em> work as broadly as possible, and make broadband digital microwave engineering as fun and accessible as possible. </p> <p>Please read about our new organization: <a href=https://openresearch.institute/about-open-research-institute/ rel=nofollow>https://openresearch.institute/about-open-research-institute/</a> <a href=https://openresearch.institute/itar-and-ear-strategy/ rel=nofollow>https://openresearch.institute/itar-and-ear-strategy/</a></p> </div> </main>
