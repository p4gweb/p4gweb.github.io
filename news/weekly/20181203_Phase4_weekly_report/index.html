This tests transmitter, antenna, processing, and sensing. Next steps would be two-way communications on 10GHz. </p> <p>High altitude balloon antennas have uncontrolled yaw. The current requirements are inexpensive enough to lose, hemispherical coverage, optimal gain at 70 degrees, some gain at 0 degrees (directly beneath the balloon). Circular polarization would be ideal. Otherwise, polarization tracking at the ground is required.</p> <p>Four different quadrifilar helix structures were simulated that gave a reasonable pattern. The problem so far is that these are easily realizable at GPS or 23cm frequencies, but the dimensions will be unreasonably small at 10.45GHz.</p> <p>Another new design is a patch array model. Most accessible papers at or near 10GHz for circular polarized patch arrays seem to be a record of capturing results of trial and error. This gives shapes that can be (in most cases) duplicated, but does not give a model that can be manipulated and edited to better match the requirements. </p> <p>Another aspect of the published work is the heavy influence of industrial and commercial requirements on antenna design. Very broadband designs that allow 2-3 or more bands are the goal. The pattern doesn’t have to be great and the gain isn’t that critical. When the device is held near, say, a body, then the pattern is messed up from the get go, so optimizing (and adding expense) is not generally pursued.</p> <p>So, that’s where we come in. We don’t have the same motivations or requirements as a commercial antenna deployment. We do need this antenna to be inexpensive enough to lose. Balloon payloads (and satellites, and even terrestrial gear) are lost in accidents and failures.</p> <p>Kent Britain’s Vivaldi antenna is an existing inexpensive design scheduled to be integrated and tested with the payload.</p> <p>You might be saying “Wait, Vivaldis are only linear polarized” and yes you would be right. A single Vivaldi as the downlink antenna would give the right pattern but linear polarization, meaning polarization losses on the ground. Mitigations would be a challenge. </p> <p>However, Vivaldi antennas can be made to be circularly polarized in combination.</p> <p>To achieve this, two Vivaldi antennas are orthogonally placed. They are driven by a specially designed feeding network that creates an input signal with two-way signals that have equal magnitude and orthogonal phase. This can be done with PCB techniques. </p> <p>Next steps? Antenna simulation, building, testing, and flying!</p> <p>Comment and critique welcome and encouraged. </p> <p>Volunteers of any level accepted and supported. </p> </div> </div> </div>
