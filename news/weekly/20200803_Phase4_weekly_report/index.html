If you have shop capabilities that you can offer for the Phase 4 project, then please file either an issue or a pull request and let’s add to the list below!</p> <ol><li><p>Voltera V-one circuit printer. <a href=https://www.voltera.io/product/specs rel=nofollow>https://www.voltera.io/product/specs</a></p> <p>This can handle ordinary PCB material up to 3mm thick but can also do flexible circuits on material like Kapton. </p> <p>0.2mm minimum trace width, 0402 minimum passive size, and 128mm by 116mm print area. </p> <p>It can print, cure, and solder. It can also drill but I do not have that attachment. </li> <li><p>Ultimaker 2 that has been upgraded to a 2+. We have done several microwave feeds and antenna designs including elliptical taper 10GHz horns, dual band feeds, helical structures, and more.</p> <p>We metallize using conductive paint and the results have been very good. </p> <p>Resolution of this printer setup is 0.02mm, which is good enough for 120GHz multi-reflector systems and beyond. </li> <li><p>Wood shop with metal brake, grinding wheel, and drill press. </li> <li><p>For textiles and embroidery, we have a Pfaff creative vision with embroidery deck and all the hoops. We also have a serger. </li> <li><p>Multi-purpose machine, air compressors, and a 1929 South Bend Lathe. </li> <li><p>This Tormach PCNC 440 is a small, light duty 3-axis CNC milling machine capable of working to accuracies of about a thousandth of an inch (a couple hundredths of a millimeter) within a work envelope of about 6 by 10 inches (150 by 250 millimeters). We have a reasonably complete set of ordinary tooling and work holding accessories for it. We are certainly not expert machinists, but with these tools we can make prototype runs of a wide variety of parts in materials like plastic, aluminum, and steel. Not every shape is easy or even possible to make with a 3-axis mill, but for most designs we can make a part that will work.</li> <li><p>We have access to the large laser cutter at colab.org. Use of the machine is free for non-commercial work. </ol> <p>As we enter into a stage where we will be doing more mechanical design, these are the resources that are immediately available for early prototypes. </p> </div> </main>
